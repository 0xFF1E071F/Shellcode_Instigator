# Shellcode_Instigator

Code is in the process of being broken apart into more organizable and manageable chunks. Initially project was designed to be just a directory-watcher and file copier, but then as logging capabilities were desired, for debugging purposes, a filemanager library needed to be created. This added substantial amounts of code (and even then it isn't fully complete!). Eventually, the files will be MUCH more refined (dead-code removed, comments no longer relevant stripped out, etc.). However, the code, as it stands is in a highly unstable state and is frequently undergoing massive changes.
